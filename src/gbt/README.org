* GBTx Deserialization

Optohybrid slow and fast control is done through two (tx+rx) 320 Mbps elinks

It is using a custom encoding (6b8b) with specific comma characters used to denote TTC commands such as L1A, BC0, Resync, and so on.

The 6b8b encoding allows the GBT link to be self-synchronizing, using an oversampling mechanism to align the data to the clock edge as well as a state machine that will bitslip the data until it is correctly aligned to the frame clock.

When not sending TTC commands, the Optohybrid takes the 6 bits / bx payload and concatenates them together into Wishbone requests  (16 bits of address, 32 bits of data, 1 bit read/write) that are put into a FIFO and then sent to the Wishbone master.

On the TX side, Wishbone responses are formed into 6 bit words and sent upstream to the backend.

** GBTX Timing

Timing of the elinks is described in the GBTx Manual, and copied here for reference:
